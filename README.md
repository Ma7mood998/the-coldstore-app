# Coldstore App
The cold-store app is an open-source project on GitHub that allows businesses to manage their cold storage facilities. It provides users with an intuitive interface for managing inventory, monitoring storage conditions, and generating reports. 

### Note:  
The project is **open-source**, which means that anyone can contribute to its development, and users are free to modify and customize the code to meet their specific needs.

## Development instructions:
- to run the app use:-  ionic serve
- Set up your development environment: Before you start working on your project, make sure you have all the necessary tools and dependencies installed on your machine. This includes things like Node.js, Ionic CLI, and any other libraries or frameworks you plan to use.

- Define the scope of your project: Determine what features and functionality you want to include in your project, and create a roadmap or project plan to guide your development efforts.

- Use version control: Use a version control system like Git to manage your codebase. This will help you keep track of changes, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions if needed.

- Write clean, maintainable code: Follow best practices for coding, such as writing modular, reusable code, using clear and descriptive variable names, and commenting your code to make it easier to understand.

- Test your code: Write automated tests to ensure that your code is functioning as expected. This includes unit tests to test individual components of your code, and integration tests to test how different parts of your code work together.

- Document your code: Write documentation that explains how your code works, including API references, installation instructions, and usage examples. This will make it easier for others to understand and use your code.

- Contribute to the community: Participate in the open-source community by contributing to other projects, answering questions on forums orstack overflow, and sharing your own code and knowledge with others. This can help you build relationships, gain recognition, and improve your own skills and knowledge.

- Follow security best practices: Ensure that your code is secure by following industry best practices for security, such as using encryption, avoiding hardcoded secrets, and implementing user authentication and authorization.

- Optimize performance: Optimize your code for performance by minimizing code bloat, using caching, and implementing lazy loading where possible. This will help your app run faster and more smoothly for your users.

- Continuously improve: Continuously improve your code by incorporating feedback from users and contributors, fixing bugs and issues, and adding new features and functionality. This will help keep your project relevant and valuable to your users.

## Functional requirements:

## Development Guidelines

The development of the Coldstore App is conducted by means of the collaborative approach of opening the project up for contributions from the open-source community. The project owner is the dictator role is played by Mahmood Maher. giving instructions and leading a group if any disagreement occurs.

## Communication Channel
In today's global economy, communication is an important aspect of any project. When it comes to open source projects, the success of a project can depend on how effectively the team communicates with members and users.

Communication channels are important because they allow teams to get feedback from users, who can help them make better decisions about product development and growth.

The most common communication channels that developers use are:

-Telegram for communication with authors

For Our Communcation channel we will be using telegram.

### A guide to participating in the "Cold Store" project

#### Our pledge
-	With the open-source project "Cold Store", regardless of gender identification, we promise to keep community participation abuse-free for everyone..
-	Throughout our work and interactions, we pledge to contribute to a welcoming environment.
-	Our commitment is to accept responsibility, apologize to those affected by our mistakes, and learn from them.



#### Our standards
Among the behaviors that contribute to a positive community environment are:

##### -	Be friendly and patient.
Be Welcome: We strive to create a community that is inclusive of all backgrounds and identities. It includes individuals of all races, socioeconomic classes, educational levels, genders, gender identities, ages, political beliefs, religions, etc.

##### -	Respect different opinions and experiences.
Be respectful: We won't always agree, but disagreement isn't an excuse for misbehavior. There will be times when we feel frustrated, but we shouldn't let that frustration turn into a personal attack. In order for society to be productive, people must not feel uncomfortable or threatened.
Try to understand the reason for the difference: There are always social and technical disagreements. The key to resolving differences and contrasting viewpoints is to resolve them constructively. Keep in mind that we are all different. It does not mean that someone is wrong if you do not understand why they hold a particular viewpoint. Instead, focus on solving problems and learning from them.

##### -	Be kind to others.
Choose your words carefully: Kindness to others is important. Be respectful of other participants and do not insult them. Exclusionary behavior and harassment are not acceptable.


**Unacceptable behavior includes:**
-	The use of sexual language or images.
